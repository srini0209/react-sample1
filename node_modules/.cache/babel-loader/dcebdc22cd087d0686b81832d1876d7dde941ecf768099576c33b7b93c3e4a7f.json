The browser is downloaded to the $HOME/.cache/puppeteer folder by default (starting with Puppeteer v19.0.0). See configuration for configuration options and environmental variables to control the download behavor. If you deploy a project using Puppeteer to a hosting provider, such as Render or Heroku, you might need to reconfigure the location of the cache to be within your project folder (see an example below) because not all hosting providers include $HOME/.cache into the project's deployment. For a version of Puppeteer without the browser installation, see puppeteer-core. If used with TypeScript, the minimum supported TypeScript version is 4.7.4. Configuration Puppeteer uses several defaults that can be customized through configuration files. For example, to change the default cache directory Puppeteer uses to install browsers, you can add a .puppeteerrc.cjs (or puppeteer.config.cjs) at the root of your application with the contents /** After adding the configuration file, you will need to remove and reinstall puppeteer for it to take effect. See the configuration guide for more information. puppeteer-core For every release since v1.7.0 we publish two packages: puppeteer puppeteer-core puppeteer is a product for browser automation. When installed, it downloads a version of Chrome, which it then drives using puppeteer-core. Being an end-user product, puppeteer automates several workflows using reasonable defaults that can be customized. puppeteer-core is a library to help drive anything that supports DevTools protocol. Being a library, puppeteer-core is fully driven through its programmatic interface implying no defaults are assumed and puppeteer-core will not download Chrome when installed. You should use puppeteer-core if you are connecting to a remote browser or managing browsers yourself. If you are managing browsers yourself, you will need to call puppeteer.launch with an explicit executablePath (or channel if it's installed in a standard location). When using puppeteer-core, remember to change the import: import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core'; Usage Puppeteer follows the latest maintenance LTS version of Node. Puppeteer will be familiar to people using other browser testing frameworks. You launch/connect a browser, create some pages, and then manipulate them with Puppeteer's API.
